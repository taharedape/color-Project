    "description": "Black is the darkest shade, the result of the absence or complete absorption of visible light. It is an achromatic color, literally a shade without hue, like white (its opposite) and gray. It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness, while white represents light. Black ink is the most common shade (though sometimes thought of as a colour) used for printing books, newspapers and documents, because it has the highest contrast with white paper and is the easiest to read.",
